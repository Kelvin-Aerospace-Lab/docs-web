___
##### Zed
###### Pros:
* Simple, Fast and Lightweight
* Designed for Collaboration
* Uses Rust Language
###### Cons:
* Limited Extensions (In Comparison to Visual Studio Code)
* For Windows only with Manual Compiling(Mac and Linux only)
* Limited AI Capability*

Zed is a powerful, fast code editor with growing popularity and built for group work. It still need work however as it is still growing its extension library and requires some IT skills to get it running on Windows. In addition, programmers using advanced AI for generating code and other tasks would find the limited AI a definite downside. Zed is an outstanding editor and as it develops more in the future it will most certainly establish itself as a top coding platform.
___
##### Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
###### Pros:
* Loads of Extensions
	* Extension for Collaboration and Group Work
	* Customizable Layout and Theme
* Comprehensive Debugging Tools
* Built-in Terminal
* Strong AI Integration
* Large Community and Support System
* Cross Platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
###### Cons:
* Can Struggle with Performance Under Heavy Load
	* Uses Large Amounts of System Resources
	* Occasional Stability Issues
* Potential Steep Learning Curve for Beginners

Visual Studio Code is a powerful and versatile code editor, a standard for programmers worldwide. It boasts a giant selection of extensions along with strong AI integration and a large active community. VS Code also features advanced debugging tools and a built-in terminal. On the other hand, VS Code has a steep learning curve for new coders and it also can struggle with performance when under stress from complex programs. VS Code has revolutionized coding and will continue to be a leader in coding platforms for a long time.

##### Arduino IDE
###### Pros:
* Built for Arduino Microcontrollers
* Diverse Library Selection
###### Cons:
