Kelvin Aerospace Lab is a non-profit organization dedicated to inspiring students' interest and curiosity in the fields of engineering and aerospace, providing practical engineering opportunities, and promoting STEM education. We aim to give students the opportunity to develop real technical skills through exciting projects and research.

### Technology Innovation

We will focus on technological innovation and develop a first-generation propulsion kit, control system, and test bench. This kit will serve as the foundation for a variety of propulsion kits for enthusiasts, educational purposes, and competitions. 

This includes the design, development, and testing of the engine itself; the development of the TVC control system and algorithms; and the development of the test bench and sensors.

### Manufacturing & Sales

We are committed to creating an out-of-the-box experience that eliminates the time and expense of complex engine design and manufacturing.

Users will be able to easily use the engine kit through provided tutorials and documentation. 

### Education & Social Support

We believe everyone should have access to education and opportunity.

We plan to provide kits and aid those in need, while also donating to schools and districts to expand STEM education and allow students to experience real-world engineering projects. By partnering with local communities and educators, we encourage students to pursue STEM fields and foster creative interdisciplinary learning.
