The total thrust of 48000 pounds is subdivided into three engines of 16000 -pound thrust each. This effects a shorter overall propulsion system and a shorter, lighter vehicle interstage. Furthermore, the liquid nuorine/liquid hydrogen propellant combination was chosen because of the relatively stringent performance requirements for upper stages.

Fluorine is the most reactive and energetic chemical element. It has vigorous and reliable hypergolic ignition characteristics, and superior specific impulse capabilities with most fuels. The high density of liquid fluorine, combined with high performance with liquid hydrogen, results in maximum payloads. As mission requirements become more ambitious, payload advantages from the fluorine-oxidized propellant combination should compensate for handling problems caused by fluorine toxicity and corrosiveness. Past experience has indicated that the operation of a fluorine-oxidized engine is practical at this thrust level ( 50000 pounds or less). Fluorine when used for gaseous passivation of metals renders a metallic surface resistant to future chemical reaction. Thus, once a metallic fluoride film is formed, further action by the liquid fluorine is either prevented or significantly retarded, making handling or storing of liquid fluorine less of a problem. No known elastomer is completely compatible with fluorine; however, flow tests of liquid fluorine with Teflon have given satisfactory results.

## General Engine System Description

The A-3 engine is a multiple-start, gimbaled, bipropellant system. The basic system includes a thrust chamber assembly using a combination of fuel-film ( $\mathrm{LH}_{2}$ ) and radiation cooling; propellant ducts; valves; and a control subsystem. Ignition is achieved by the hypergolicity of the propellants. These are fed directly from pressurized propellant tanks, through main propellant valves, to the thrust chamber inlets. The propellant tanks and their gas pressurization system are considered part of the engine propellant feed system. Gaseous helium supplied from a high-pressure helium bottle located inside the main fuel tank is used for main oxidizer tank
pressurization. The main fuel tank is pressurized by gaseous hydrogen supplied from a liquid hydrogen bottle which is pressurized by helium and which is also located inside the main fuel tank. Both pressurants are heated in heat exchangers located at the thrust chamber nozzle extensions before they are expanded through pressure regulators and transferred to the propellant tanks. Helium gas is used to operate the main valves and the gimbal actuators, and to purge the propellant manifolds during start.

A-3 engine operating parameters, for vacuum conditions, are presented in table 3-4. The propulsion system schematic diagram is shown in figure 3-6.

The design of the entire propulsion system is governed by simplicity and minimum number of components. This is essential because of the
highly reactive and toxic nature of fluorine. Welded joints are used extensively. No rotating seals are employed. Sliding seals are of the metal-bellows type.

A preliminary design layout of the A-3 propulsion system and dimensions are shown in figure 3-7.

The fuel tank is pressure stabilized rather than mechanically stabilized. The thrust loads are transmitted to the payload through the fuel tank. Both tanks are insulated, as are the ducts between tanks and engine systems.

Thrust-vector control is achieved by gimbaling the thrust chambers. Each basic engine weighs approximately 330 pounds dry and 365 pounds at burnout. It has a cylindrical space envelope of 5 feet 4 inches diameter by 7 feet 6 inches length. The propulsion system (including the three engines and the tankage) weighs

## System Operation

The A-3 propulsion system is designed for automatic start, on receipt of a signal from the guidance system. A similar signal effects automatic engine shutdown. One or more restarts can be made by merely sending additional start and shutdown signals to the propulsion system.

Figure 3-8 shows the operational sequence of the A-3 stage engine. In conjunction with figure $3-6$, this illustrates the system starting and shutdown operations.
