Fixed-area-type regulating devices, such as orifices, nozzles, and venturis, are frequently used in rocket engines for fluid system calibration and for control purposes. Although the energy loss caused by an orifice is high, as compared to that of nozzles or venturis, orifices are extensively used because of their compactness and simplicity (fig. 7-2).

## Orifices and Nozzles for Liquid Flow

The basic correlations for liquid flow through orifices and nozzles are (assuming uniform flow distribution):

$$
\begin{gather*}
\dot{V}=0.0438 C d_{0}^{2} \sqrt{\Delta h}=0.525 C d_{0}^{2} \sqrt{\frac{\Delta p}{\rho}}(7-21) \\
\dot{W}=0.0438 C d_{0}^{2} \rho \sqrt{\Delta h}=0.525 C d_{0}^{2} \sqrt{\Delta p \rho}(7-22) \\
k=\frac{\Delta p_{0}}{\Delta p} \tag{7-23}
\end{gather*}
$$

where
$\dot{V}=$ volumetric flow rate, $\mathrm{ft}^{3} / \mathrm{sec}$
$\dot{w}=$ weight flow rate, $\mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}$
$\rho=$ density of the fluid, $\mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{ft}^{3}$
$\Delta h=$ static pressure head drop across the orifice or nozzle, ft
$\Delta p=$ static pressure drop across the orifice or nozzle, psi
$d_{0}=$ diameter of the orifice or nozzle throat, in
$d_{1}=$ diameter of the duct leading to the orifice or nozzle, in
$C=$ flow coefficient for orifices or nozzles. Considers the effects of discharge jet contraction in orifices, velocity of approach, diameter ratio $d_{0} / d_{1}$, friction and flow profile
$\Delta p_{0}=$ total (or permanent) pressure drop chargeable to the orifice or nozzle, psi
$k=$ factor, correcting nozzle or orifice working pressure to permanent pressure loss
The correlations are still reasonably accurate for gas flows, if the pressure drop across the control orifice is small ( $<10$ percent).

The value of flow coefficients $C$ is a function of the design configurations and flow Reynolds
number and can only be evaluated by experiments. Typical designs and flow coefficients of frequently used orifices and flow nozzles are presented in figures $7-51$ (a), 7-51(b), and 7-51(c). Orifices of the VDI type are preferred because their behavior is more predictable. This is attributable to the bevel at the backside, which prevents erratic wall reattachment of the contracted jet within the orifice. It is important that the leading edge be absolutely sharp. The value of $k$ is a function of the diameter ratio ( $d_{0} / d_{1}$ ). The ( $\Delta p_{0} / \Delta p$ ) versus ( $d_{0} / d_{1}$ ) relationship is plotted in figure 7-52.

## Sample Calculation (7-7)

The following data are given for the fuel pump discharge duct of the A-1 engine:

Required fuel weight flow rate, $\dot{w}=892 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}$
Fuel pump discharge duct diameter, $d_{1}=7$ in
Selected design value of total pressure drop for orifice or flow nozzle installed in the fuel duct, $\Delta p_{0}=100 \mathrm{psi}$
Estimate the required diameter $d_{0}$, (a) for a VDI-type orifice, and (b) for a VDI-type flow nozzle (figs. 7-51(a) and 7-51(c)).

## Solution

The average flow velocity in the fuel duct

$$
v=\frac{\dot{w}}{\rho \frac{\pi}{4}\left(d_{1}\right)^{2}}=\frac{892}{50.45 \times \frac{\pi}{4} \times\left(\frac{7}{12}\right)^{2}}=66.3 \mathrm{fps}
$$

From table 6-3, we obtain the viscosity of $\mathrm{RP}-1=3.22 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{lb}-\mathrm{sec} / \mathrm{in}^{2}$, or $\mu=3.22 \times 10^{-7} \times 4636.8=1.494 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{ft}$-sec (see eq. 7-6).

The Reynolds number, based on duct diameter $d_{1}$

$$
R_{e}=\frac{D v \rho}{\mu}=\frac{\frac{7}{12} \times 66.3 \times 50.45}{1.494 \times 10^{-3}}=1.306 \times 10^{6}
$$

From equations (7-22) and (7-23)

$$
\begin{align*}
& \dot{w}=0.525 C d_{0}^{2} \sqrt{\Delta p_{\rho}}=0.525 C d_{0}^{2} \sqrt{\Delta p_{0} \rho / k} \\
& \begin{aligned}
\frac{C d_{0}^{2}}{\sqrt{k}} & =\frac{\dot{w}}{0.525 \sqrt{\Delta p_{0} \rho}}=\frac{892}{0.525 \times \sqrt{100 \times 50.45}} \\
& =\frac{892}{0.525 \times 71}=23.9
\end{aligned}
\end{align*}
$$

(a) For the VDI-type orifice, we determine by trial and error that $d_{0}$, which will simultaneously satisfy equation (a), figure $7-51(\mathrm{a})$, and figure 7-52. A value of 4.47 inches is found for $d_{0}$. Confirm:

$$
\frac{d_{0}}{d_{1}}=\frac{4.47}{7}=0.638
$$

From figure $7-51$ (a), a value of $C=0.67$ is derived for $R_{e}=1.306 \times 10^{6}$. A corresponding

Figure 7-52.- $\left(\Delta p_{0} / \Delta p\right)$ versus $\left(d_{0} / d_{1}\right)$ for orifices and nozzles.

value of 0.32 for $k$ is obtained from figure 7-52. Substitute this into equation (a):

$$
\frac{C d_{0}^{2}}{\sqrt{\bar{k}}}=\frac{0.67 \times(4.47)^{2}}{\sqrt{0.32}}=23.9
$$

(b) For the VDI-type flow nozzle, the same approach can be used to determine $d_{0}$. A value of 3.55 inches is found for $d_{0}$; thus

$$
\frac{d_{0}}{d_{1}}=\frac{3.55}{7}=0.506
$$

From figure $7-51$ (c), a value of $C=1.005$ is obtained, for $R_{\mathrm{e}}=1.306 \times 10^{6}$. From figure 7-52, the corresponding value for $k$ is 0.28 . Substitute this into equation (a):

$$
\frac{C d_{0}^{2}}{\sqrt{k}}=\frac{1.005 \times(3.55)^{2}}{\sqrt{0.28}}=23.9
$$

Thus, for the VDI orifice, $d_{0}=4.47 \mathrm{in}$; for the VDI flow nozzle, $d_{0}=3.55 \mathrm{in}$.

## Orifices for Gas Flow

The basic correlations for an isentropic, compressible gas flow through an orifice are:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\dot{w}=\frac{C A p_{1} Z}{\sqrt{R T}} \tag{7-24}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $\left(p_{2} / p_{1}\right) \leqq$ Critical ratio, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\leqq\left(\frac{2}{\gamma+1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}, Z=\sqrt{g \gamma\left(\frac{2}{\gamma+1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma+1}{\gamma-1}}} \tag{7-25}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $\left(p_{2} / p_{1}\right)>$ Critical ratio,

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\sqrt{\frac{2 g y}{y-1}\left[\left(\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\right)^{\frac{2}{Y}}-\left(\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\right)^{\frac{\gamma+1}{\gamma}}\right]} \tag{7-26}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$\dot{w}=$ gas weight flow rate, lb/sec
$A=$ orifice area, in ${ }^{2}$
$p_{1}$ gas pressure upstream of the orifice, psia
$p_{2}=$ gas pressure downstream of the orifice, psia
$R=$ gas constant, $\mathrm{ft} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{R}$
$T=$ gas temperature upstream of the orifice, ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{R}$
$Z=$ compressibility factor, $\mathrm{ft}^{0.5} / \mathrm{sec}$
$\gamma=$ gas specific heat ratio
$C=$ flow coefficient, a function of design configuration and flow Reynolds number. May be approximated from figure 7-51(a) and 7-51(b)
$g=$ gravitational constant, $32.2 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}^{2}$

Figure 7-53.-Compressibility factors for an isentropic compressible flow through an orifice.

Values for $Z$ applicable to equation (7-24) for various pressure ratios ( $p_{2} / p_{1}$ ) are presented in figure 7-53.

## Sample Calculation (7-8)

The following data are given for an orifice:
Orifice diameter, $d_{0}=0.06$ in
Flow coefficient, $C=0.6$
Helium gas pressure $=500 \mathrm{psig}$
Helium gas temperature $=100^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
Calculate the orifice flow rates for downstream pressure, $p_{2}=14.7$ (ambient) and $p_{2}=350$ psia.

## Solution

For a downstream pressure of 14.7 psia , the orifice pressure ratio

$$
\left(\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\right)=\frac{14.7}{500+14.7}=0.0286
$$

From figure $7-53$, the compressibility factor $Z$ is derived as 4.11 for $\gamma=1.66$. Substitute this and other parameters into equation (7-24):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{W} & =\frac{C A p_{1} Z}{\sqrt{R T}}=\frac{0.6 \times \frac{\pi}{4}(0.06)^{2} \times(500+14.7) \times 4.11}{\sqrt{386 \times(460+100)}} \\
& =\frac{0.6 \times 0.00283 \times 514.7 \times 4.11}{\sqrt{386 \times 560}}=0.00774 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
\end{aligned}
$$

For a downstream pressure of 350 psia , the orifice pressure ratio

$$
\left(\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\right)=\frac{350}{514.7}=0.682
$$

From figure $7-53$, we obtain a compressibility factor $Z=3.88$; thus

$$
\dot{w}=\frac{3.88}{4.11} \times 0.0077=0.00726 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
$$
