Figure 6-63 presents the design layout of the A-1 stage engine turbopump assembly. Logical packaging and arranging of the basic mechanical elements of the turbopump are among the
considerations in preparing the layout. For instance, one of the more important criteria which influences the selection or arranging of the turbopump mechanical elements is the ease of development. Standard or proven mechanical detail should be extensively adopted in the layouts. The following is a list of important turbopump design layout considerations:
(1) Compatibility with engine systems packaging and plumbing
(2) Structural integrity
(3) Positive interpropellant sealing
(4) Compensation for thermal expansion and contraction
(5) Ease of development
(6) Ease of assembly
(7) Ease of manufacturing

Considerable experience and skill are required in turbopump design layout work for best results.
