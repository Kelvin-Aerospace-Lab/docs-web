So far, numerous important basic considerations for rocket engine design have been discussed. The detailed engine design procedures and the treatment of typical examples as they may occur in practice will now follow. The questions are where to start, how to proceed, and what are the expected results.

It would be beyond the scope of this book to describe the detailed mechanics of the generation of design drawings, their breakdown, their execution, and the system for their release. The young engineer, who uses this book and already works in industry, knows. The student reader can be assured that the future employer has a manual (usually voluminous) covering this subject exhaustively, and which is slanted to his specific needs. The following are specific design techniques as they are used in liquid rocket engine design. Many of these techniques will be

Assuming that it has been ascertained beyond doubt (has it?) that a design change must be made, check that the effect of this change is fully understood and implemented in the following areas:

1. Interchangeability of changed parts.
2. "Chain Reaction" to other parts and systems, including vehicle, test facilities, and GSE.
3. Engine start and stop sequence.
4. Engine performance. including gain factors.
5. Conformance with all specifications.
6. Weight, envelope, c.g.. moments of inertia, loads
7. Reliability.
8. Instrumentation, data recording, telemetry.
9. Packaging, shipping, storage
10. Development and qualification.
11. Human factors: skills, training, notification of persons concerned.

applied in subsequent chapters, in connection with the discussion and demonstration of various component designs.

The activities discussed below are not clearly separated phases, following one another in a rigid sequence. Rather, they overlap, frequently occur in parallel, and are tightly interwoven. One of the first drawings the liquid-rocket designer will most likely prepare is a schematic diagram of the engine system. A typical example is shown in figure 2-10. This diagram shows how the principal components are linked together. The schematic may be accompanied by a sequence diagram, showing the operation of each compo-
nent in relation to the other as a function of time (fig. 2-11).

Concurrently, analyses will have been conducted to establish preliminary engine performance parameters and operating characteristics, as well as individual component configurations and operating principles. A typical example of a performance diagram is shown in figure 3-1. Engine and component starting and operating characteristics can be analytically predicted with a high degree of accuracy by computers. Thus, important knowledge required for optimum design is obtained long before the part is actually built and tested. Savings in time and cost are

substantial. These analyses and computer programs will draw heavily upon experience with earlier systems and on advanced design studies.

Once the prototype schematic diagram is considered completed, and performance parameters have been established by the analysis, the first actual "engine picture" will be drawn. This very likely will be a general, in-scale preliminary layout of the engine system and components. A typical example of an engine system preliminary layout is shown in figure 3-2.

Through continued analyses, calculations, consultations, and joint reviews by all participants, the layout will gradually take final shape. In this process, nothing should be left to chance.

Consultations with specialists in their fields and rigorous calculations doublechecked for accuracy and presented in a readily understood form, will contribute materially. Layout drawings should be made accurately and to true scale. In this manner, all components of the engine system will have been designed and optimized for one another, rather than "hung on a mounting frame in Christmas-tree fashion."

Before working drawings are made from the layouts, they should again be reviewed, and revised as necessary, taking into consideration all design aspects, the basic considerations, and the reliability assurance aspects, which were discussed earlier.
