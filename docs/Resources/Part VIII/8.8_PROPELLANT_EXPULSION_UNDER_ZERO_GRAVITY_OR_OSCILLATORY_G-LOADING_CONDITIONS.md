Under zero or oscillatory g-loading conditions typical for many vehicle trajectories, fluid location in a propellant tank become 3 uncertain and requires means to prevent gas po zkets from interfering with propellant expulsion. The propellants must be either subjected to an acceleration forcs for settling immediately prior to usage, or they must be continuously confined in the tank. The two approaches can be defined as impulse settling and positive expulsion.

## Impulse Settling

This method employs a small propulsive force directed axially, parallel to the vehicle centerline of thrust. This acceleration forces the propellant to cover the tank outlet prior to initiation of main engine operation. This approach is especially suitable for most space vehicles, because their low-thrust reaction control units can be used to perform the auxiliary function of providing the thrust required for propellant settling.

Although this method would eliminate the need for positive expulsion devices for the main propellant tanks, it would necessitate separate positive-expulsion propellant tank or tanks for the sole use of the reaction control system. The possible disadvantages of this impulse-settling method are (1) no control of vehicle center-ofgravity shifts, and (2) low thrust-to-weight ratio under these conditions, which may increase response times beyond tolerable limits.

For single-start upper stages, jettisonable short-duration solid settling rockets may also be applied to advantage.

## Positive Expulsion

The other method of achieving proper fluid orientation within the propellant tanks is by continuously confining the propellant to the vicinity of the tank outlet. A positive expulsion propellant tank assembly usually consists of an outer tank shell and an inner movable expulsion device. Frequently used positive expulsion devices are: (1) metallic diaphragms, (2) elastomer diaphragms, and (3) moveable pistons. The design of the expulsion devices depends upon a number of considerations. Primary among these is the design configuration of the propellant tank. Another is the allowable shift of vehicle center of gravity during expulsion, which in many vehicle applications must be minimized to avoid instabilities induced by a pitch or yaw maneuver. A choice of construction materials capable of sustained contact with the pressurants and propellants must also be made.

## Metal Expulsion Diaphragms

Metal expulsion diaphragms made of $1100-0$ aluminum ( 0.010 to 0.020 inch thick) are desirable for long-term storage contact with storable
propellants and higher temperature pressurant gases. Figure 8-17 presents a concentriccircular, convoluted metal positive expulsion diaphragm used in a spherical tank. This system is unique for bipropellant systems because it allows both propellants to be stored in the same tank, as long as the volumetric mixture ratio does not deviate appreciably from unity. An expulsion efficiency above 97 percent (i.e.. the percentage of the propellant which can be expelled from the tank) may be expected. This design also minimizes shift of center of gravity during the entire process of expulsion.

Figure 8-18 presents the corrugated metal positive expulsion diaphragm applied to a cylindrical tank. A center post is provided to support the diaphragm. The diaphragm is formed into a lobed corrugation capable of performing the required mechanical expansion. Transition sections are provided at both ends of the diaphragm for attachment to the tank ends. An expulsion efficiency of 97 to 98 percent may be achieved with this design. However, the utilization of

tank volume is less efficient due to dimensional limitations (i.e., size of the center post compared to tank diameter). This design, too, minimizes shift of center of gravity.

One disadvantage of the metal diaphragms is that only one complete expulsion cycle is possible, because the metal probably will be cold worked. The cold working not only changes metal elastic properties and the $\Delta p$ required for expulsion, but may cause fatigue failure.

## Elastomer Expulsion Diaphragms

Elastomer-type diaphragms are applicable to most tank configurations and often offer a more efficient utilization of tank volume. One design approach takes advantage of the stretching properties of pure elastomer and uses the diaphragm as a bladder. Figure 8-19 presents the bladdertype elastomer positive expulsion diaphragm used in a spherical tank. As the bladder is pressurized and inflates, the propellant is displaced and positively expelled and uniformly confined during all phases of expulsion. By positioning the bladder in the geometric center of the tank, center-of-gravity shift during expulsion is virtually eliminated.

The initial unpressurized volume within the bladder can be utilized as the ullage volume. The elastomer diaphragm will produce an expulsion efficiency of up to 99 percent in many tank configurations. In addition, it is capable of many expulsion and refill cycles. An inherent

disadvantage of pure elastomers in storage contact with many storable propellants is tensilestrength degradation as a function of time. They are also incompatible with hot pressurant gases produced by gas generators.

## Positive Expulsion By Movable Pistons

An alternate method of obtaining positive expulsion in cylindrical tanks is a movable piston actuated by pressurant gas. Positive attachment is required during storage to keep the piston in the proper position. To prevent leakage during operation, seals will be required. The seals may be piston-type rings or some type of metallic wiper seal. In either case, the dimension and surface finish of the tank inside diameter should be maintained relatively accurate and smooth. In some designs a concentric center post is utilized to guide the piston, requiring an additional seal. Figure 8-20 presents the design of a movable piston guided by a center post.

The pressure differential across the movable piston required to overcome friction during operation increases the required pressurant pressure and the tank structural pressure loads for a given propellant pressure at the tank outlet. It may be estimated by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta p A_{p}=f_{S} F_{n} L_{S} \tag{8-39}
\end{equation*}
$$

where
$\Delta p=$ pressure differential across the piston, psi

## Sample Calculation (8-7)

The following data are given for a cylindrical positive expulsion tank with a movable piston as shown in figure 8-20:

Inside diameter of the tank, 20 in
Diameter of the guide post, 1.5 in
Coefficient of friction of the piston seals, $f_{s}=0.1$
Unit normal force reacted by the seals, $F_{n} =500 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{in}$

Estimate the pressure differential across the movable piston.

## Solution

The cross-sectional area of the piston
$A_{p}=\frac{\pi \times(20)^{2}}{4}-\frac{\pi \times(1.5)^{2}}{4}=314.16-1.76=312.4 \mathrm{in}^{2}$
The total length of piston seals:

$$
L_{S}=\pi \times(20+1.5)=67.54 \mathrm{in}
$$

Substitute this into equation (8-39); the pressure differential across the piston

$$
\Delta p=\frac{I_{s} F_{n} L_{s}}{A_{p}}=\frac{0.1 \times 500 \times 67.54}{312.4}=10.8 \mathrm{psi}
$$
