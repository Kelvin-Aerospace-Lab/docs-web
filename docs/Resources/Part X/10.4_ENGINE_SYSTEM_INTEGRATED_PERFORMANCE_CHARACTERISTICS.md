In the process of engine system design integration, an important task is the integration of engine system performance characteristics. These data are prepared and compiled by the rocket engine designer to provide the vehicle systems engineer with information necessary to integrate the propulsion system with the vehicle system. Where possible, a brief explanation of the data and its application should be included to provide clearer understanding and greater usefulness. The following are important aspects of integrated engine performance characteristics.

## Nominal Engine Performance Values at Rated Conditions

These are usually prescribed by the engine model specification. These data are for engine system nominal steady-state operation, at rated conditions. Tables $3-2$ to $3-5$ are typical examples of nominal engine operating and performance parameters, which include nominal thrust, specific impulse, propellant combination, flow rates, mixture ratio, and various component operating data. Allowable deviations are specified for important parameters such as: thrust, $\pm 3$ percent, and mixture ratio, $\pm 2$ percent. Engine system specific impulse is usually specified at its minimum value. The performance of all deliverable engine systems must be above this minimum during acceptance tests.

In addition to tables for nominal engine performance parameters, nominal engine performance graphs such as chamber pressure versus engine thrust, and engine specific impulse versus engine thrust, are often included as additional monitoring aid. Figure 10-7 presents a typical performance graph for the A-1 stage engine system, of chamber pressure versus engine thrust at sea level.

## Sample Calculation (10-3)

The following data were obtained from design analyses and component tests of the A-1 stage LOX/RP-1 engine system at nominal rated conditions; i.e., 750000 pounds thrust at sea level:

Thrust chamber sea level specific impulse at 1000-psia nozzle stagnation pressure, and a mixture ratio of $2.35 \mathrm{O} / \mathrm{F}=270 \mathrm{sec}$
Turbine exhaust gas specific impulse $=32.6$ sec
Oxidizer pump developed head $=2930 \mathrm{ft}$
Oxidizer pump overall efficiency $=70.7$ percent
Fuel pump developed head $=4790 \mathrm{ft}$
Fuel pump overall efficiency $=65.9$ percent
Gas generator $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{F}$ mixture ratio $=0.408$
Turbine gas available energy content $=359$ Btu/lb
Turbine overall efficiency $=58.2$ percent
Required auxiliary drive shaft power $=500$ bhp

Required oxidizer flow for vehicle tank pressurization $=3 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}$
Determine the following nominal performance values at rated conditions:
(a) Thrust generated by the turbine exhaust gas
(b) Thrust generated by the main thrust chamber
(c) Engine system propellant flow rates
(d) Engine system mixture ratio
(e) Engine system specific impulse

## Solution

A trial-and-error method is used to solve this problem. Our first step is to approximate engine system and gas generator propellant flow rates. We substitute thrust chamber $l_{S}$ into equation (1-28):

$$
\dot{w}=\frac{F}{I_{\mathrm{s}}}=\frac{750000}{270}=2778 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
$$

The thrust chamber mixture ratio can now be used to approximate the corresponding oxidizer and fuel flow rates:

Engine oxidizer flow rate

$$
\dot{w}_{o}=\frac{2778 \times 2.35}{(2.35+1)}=1948 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
$$

Oxidizer flow rate $=1948+3=1951 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}$
Engine fuel flow rate $\dot{w}_{f}=2778-1948=830 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}$
From equations (6-12) and (6-13), the required oxidizer and fuel pump drive horse power for this approximation are:

Oxidizer pump horsepower $=\frac{1951 \times 2930}{550 \times 0.706}=14720 \mathrm{hp}$

Fuel pump horsepower $=\frac{830 \times 4790}{550 \times 0.659}=10960 \mathrm{hp}$

The corresponding turbine shaft horsepower:

$$
T_{\mathrm{hp}}=14720+10960+500=26180 \mathrm{hp}
$$

From equation (6-19), the corresponding turbine gas flow rate:

$$
\dot{w}_{t}=\frac{0.707 \times 26180}{359 \times 0.582}=88.4 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
$$

We use this value to start a new calculation cycle to separate main chamber and gas generator data.

The thrust generated by a turbine exhaust gas flow rate of $88.4 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}=88.4 \times 32.6=2880 \mathrm{lb}$.

Thus the main chamber thrust:

$$
F_{t}=750000-2880=747120 \mathrm{lb}
$$

Thrust chamber flow rate

$$
\dot{w}_{\mathrm{tc}}=\frac{747120}{270}=2769 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
$$

Oxidizer pump flow rate

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{88.4 \times 0.408}{1+0.408}+\frac{2769 \times 2.35}{1+2.35}+3 \\
& =25.6+1942+3=1970.6 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
\end{aligned}
$$

Fuel pump flow rate

$$
=(88.4-25.6)+(2769-1942)=889.8 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
$$

Turbine shaft horsepower
$T_{\mathrm{hp}}=\frac{1970.6 \times 2930}{550 \times 0.706}+\frac{889.8 \times 4790}{550 \times 0.659}+500=27090 \mathrm{hp}$

Turbine gas flow rate

$$
\dot{w}_{t}=\frac{0.707 \times 27090}{359 \times 0.582}=91.7 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
$$

We use this value for another calculation trial:

The thrust generated by a turbine exhaust gas flow rate of $91.7 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}=91.7 \times 32.6=2980 \mathrm{lb}$.

Main chamber thrust $F_{t}=750000-2980=747020 \mathrm{lb}$
Thrust chamber flow rate

$$
\dot{w}_{\mathrm{tc}}=\frac{747020}{270}=2768 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
$$

Oxidizer pump flow rate

$$
=\frac{91.7 \times 0.408}{1+0.408}+\frac{2768 \times 2.35}{1+2.35}+3=1970.6 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
$$

Fuel pump flow rate

$$
=(91.7-26.6)+(2768-1941)=892.1 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
$$

Turbine shaft horsepower

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{\mathrm{hp}} & =\frac{1970.6 \times 2930}{550 \times 0.706}+\frac{892.1 \times 4790}{550 \times 0.659}+500 \\
& =14850+11790+500=27140 \mathrm{hp}
\end{aligned}
$$

Turbine gas flow rate $\dot{w}_{t}=\frac{0.707 \times 27140}{359 \times 0.582}=92 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}$
This value closely confirms the assumptions for the last trial. Thus:
(a) Nominal turbine exhaust gas thrust

$$
=92 \times 32.6=3000 \mathrm{lb}
$$

(b) Nominal main thrust chamber thrust

$$
=750000-3000=747000 \mathrm{lb}
$$

(c) Nominal thrust chamber propellant flow

$$
\text { rate }=747000 / 270=2768 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
$$

Nominal engine system propellant flow rate $=2768+92=2860 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}$
Nominal engine system oxidizer flow rate

$$
=\frac{92 \times 0.408}{1+0.408}+\frac{2768 \times 2.35}{1+2.35}=1967.7 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}
$$

Nominal engine system fuel flow rate $=(92-26.7)+(2768-1941)=892.3 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{sec}$
(d) Nominal engine system O/F mixture ratio $=1967.7 / 892.3=2.20$
(e) Nominal engine specific impulse $=750000 / 2860=262.4 \mathrm{sec}$

## Engine Performance Variations Resulting From Off-Nominal Conditions

Engine performance characteristics at various off-nominal conditions must be available to the vehicle system engineer. They can be summarized in the graphic form such as figure 2-1 (engine thrust and specific impulse versus altitude curve), or by means of tabulated engine influence coefficients which will be discussed. The effects of off-nominal conditions of the following engine system performance parameters are considered vital for the design of a vehicle system:
(1) Atmospheric pressure
(2) Propellant densities
(3) Pressures at the engine propellant inlets
(4) Propellant mixture ratio and vehicle PU control
(5) Vehicle acceleration
(6) Throttling of the engine system

## Engine Influence Coefficients

These are used to convert or correct steadystate, main-stage engine system performance parameters (dependent variables) from one condition to another of parameters (independent variables) such as atmospheric pressure, fuel temperature, oxidizer density, etc. This may be a correction to standard sea-level conditions (firststage booster engine), or a conversion to other specified conditions. The coefficients are derived from the linearized solution of a set of steady-state differential equations which describe the performance of an engine system. These equations are solved by a digital computer and presented in tabular form, as shown in table 10-1 for the A-1 stage engine system. Each influence coefficient is expressed as a percentage and represents the change of a dependent engine variable, such as thrust, as produced by a 1 -percent change in an independent variable, such as atmospheric pressure. A coefficient preceded by a positive sign ( + ) indicates that an increase of an independent variable produces an increase in the dependent variable. Conversely, a coefficient with a negative sign indicates a decrease in the dependent variable, as a result of independent variable increase. These influence coefficients are usually sufficiently accurate over the entire design operation range of an engine system.

Because the influence coefficients are linear, the total effects of several influences acting simultaneously on an engine system can be determined by summing the individual effects. For
example, the change of engine thrust for the A-1 stage engine system (without $C^{*}$ correction) can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\left(F-F_{n}\right)}{F_{n}}= & \frac{C_{1}\left(p_{\mathrm{a}}-p_{\mathrm{an}}\right)}{p_{\mathrm{an}}}+\frac{C_{2}\left(\rho_{o}-\rho_{o n}\right)}{\rho_{o n}}+\frac{C_{3}\left(\rho_{f}-\rho_{\mathrm{fn}}\right)}{\rho_{\mathrm{fn}}} \\
& +\frac{C_{4}\left(p_{o \mathrm{i}}-p_{o \mathrm{in}}\right)}{p_{o i n}}+\frac{C_{5}\left(p_{\mathrm{fi}}-p_{\mathrm{fin}}\right)}{p_{\mathrm{fin}}}(10-26) \tag{10-26}
\end{align*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F, F_{\mathrm{n}} \quad \begin{array}{c}
=\text { engine system thrust and its nominal } \\
\text { value, } \mathrm{lb}
\end{array} \\
& p_{\mathrm{a}}, p_{\mathrm{an}}=\text { atmospheric pressure and its nominal } \\
& \quad \text { value, psia } \\
& \rho_{o}, \rho_{\mathrm{on}}=\begin{array}{c}
\text { oxidizer density and its nominal } \\
\text { value, } \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{ft}^{3}
\end{array} \\
& \rho_{f}, \rho_{\mathrm{fn}}=\begin{array}{c}
\text { fuel density and its nominal value, } \\
\mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{ft}^{3}
\end{array} \\
& p_{\mathrm{oi}}, p_{\mathrm{oin}}=\begin{array}{c}
\text { oxidizer pump inlet suction pressure } \\
\text { and its nominal value, psia }
\end{array} \\
& p_{\mathrm{fi}}, p_{\mathrm{fin}}=\text { fuel pump inlet suction pressure and } \\
& \text { its nominal value, psia } \\
& C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}, C_{4}, C_{5}=\text { influence coefficients }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Sample Calculation (10-4)

Atmospheric pressure, $p_{a}=10.2 \mathrm{psia}$
Oxidizer density, $\rho_{0}=71.00 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{ft}^{3}$
Fuel density, $\rho_{f}=50.90 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{ft}^{3}$

## Solution

From equation (10-26) and table 10-1:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\left(F-F_{n}\right)}{F_{n}}=\frac{(-0.178) \times(10.2-14.696)}{14.696} \\
& +\frac{1.875 \times(71.0-71.38)}{71.38}+\frac{(-0.742) \times(50.90-50.45)}{50.45} \\
& +\frac{0.044 \times(65-55)}{55}+\frac{(-0.0066) \times(49-45)}{45} \\
& =0.04531 \text { or } 4.531 \text { percent }
\end{aligned}
$$

Engine system thrust of an altitude, where $p_{a}=10.2 \mathrm{psia}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
F & =0.04531 \times F_{n}+F_{n}=0.04531 \times 750000+750000 \\
& =784000 \mathrm{lb}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Nonlinear Corrections

When the linear approximation is not sufficiently accurate, the usefulness of the engine influence coefficients can be extended by a technique which allows nonlinear corrections for certain parameters. An example of this method is the $C^{*}$ correction. For instance, a plot of $C^{*}$ correction versus engine mixture ratio change may be used in conjunction with a table of influence coefficients such as figure 10-8 and table

![](/img/DLPRE/image_342.jpg)
Figure 10-8.-C* correction versus change in engine mixture ratio curve for the A-1 stage engine.

10-1, which are for the A-1 engine system. The change of engine mixture ratio is computed for changes in atmospheric pressure, propellant densities, etc., assuming the $C^{*}$ correction first to be zero. For the resultant change in engine mixture ratio, the $C^{*}$ correction is read from the graph. The value of $C^{*}$ correction found is then used with other independent variables to compute the changes in the remaining dependent variables.

## Sample Calculation (10-5)

Estimate the thrust of the A-1 stage engine system operated at the conditions listed for sample calculation (10-4), adding the effects of $C^{*}$ correction. Also, for the same conditions, estimate the thrust assuming an additional mixture ratio error of +10 percent, due to faulty calibration.

## Solution

By analogy with equation (10-26) and using table 10-1, the engine system mixture ratio change due to the conditions of sample calculation (10-4) are determined as

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\left(M R-M R_{n}\right)}{M R_{n}}=\frac{1.642 \times(71.0-71.38)}{71.38} \\
& \quad+\frac{(-1.365) \times(50.90-50.45)}{50.45}+\frac{0.027 \times(65-55)}{55} \\
& \quad+\frac{(-0.002) \times(49-45)}{45}=-0.0162 \text { or }-1.62 \text { percent }
\end{aligned}
$$

From figure 10-8, the $C^{*}$ correction for a mixture ratio change of -1.62 percent is approximately -0.02 percent. From table $10-1$, the influence coefficient for engine system thrust is 1.1030 , for a 1 percent $C^{*}$ correction. Thus
$($ Percent change in $F)=4.531+(-0.02) \times 1.103$

$$
=4.509 \text { percent }
$$

Therefore, engine system thrust considering effects of $C^{*}$ correction:

$$
F=750000 \times(1+0.04509)=783820 \mathrm{lb}
$$

If the mixture ratio error of 10 percent is added, the total mixture ratio change $=10-1.62$
$=8.38$ percent. From figure 10-8, the $C^{*}$ correction then is approximately -0.11 percent.

Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\text { Percent change in } F) & =4.531+(-0.11) \times 1.103 \\
& =0.441, \text { or } 4.41 \text { percent }
\end{aligned}
$$

Engine system thrust:

$$
F=750000 \times(1+0.0441)=783080 \mathrm{lb}
$$
