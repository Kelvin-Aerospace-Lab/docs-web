Pressurization systems using hot gaseous products generated from solid or liquid propellants have been successfully developed for the storable liquid propellant engine systems. Another technique used with noncryogenics is the main propellant tank injection pressurization system. Here a hypergolic fluid is injected into the tank and pressurization is provided by the products of the reaction occurring within the tank.

These methods are not applicable to cryogenic propellants because the products of reaction, such as water, will solidify, and because the heat of combustion will raise undesirably the bulk temperature of the cryogenic propellant. Especially in the case of liquid hydrogen, bulk heating cannot be tolerated because of its limited liquid range (normal boiling point to critical point).

Two important considerations for the application of combustion products for pressurization are: propellant compatibility and gas temperature level. Except for very short operating durations (few seconds), fuel-rich hot gases are used for fuel tanks, to prevent reactions. Similarly, oxidizer-rich hot gases are applied to oxidizer tanks. The temperature of the product gas pressurant should be maintained at, or should be cooled to, a level below $1200^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

## Solid Propellant Gas Generator Pressurization Systems

Several effective solid-propellant gas-generator systems have been developed for tank pressurization of prepackaged storable liquid propulsion systems. Pressurant gas temperatures up to $3000^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ and tank pressures up to 2000 psia have been proven successful for short-duration applications. This pressurization method is primarily employed for its inherent simplicity, low production cost, long-term storability, relatively light
system weight, and compactness. The system is usually composed of two electrically fired initiators, or squibs, a charge of igniter pellets, safety and arming devices, a pressure-relief-type regulator, and the propellant grains. A device to cool the hot gases may be required in specific applications.

Figure 5-9 shows a typical design. The solid-propellant gas-generator assembly is enclosed in an insulated steel housing. This housing is installed within an aluminum casing, which in turn is an integral part of the propellant tank constructed of aluminum alloy. The gas generator unit is completely integrated into a compact package ready for testing, storage, and installation into the propulsion system, with minimum effort and maximum safety. All gas outlets are hermetically sealed with burst dia-
phragms to maintain system reliability even after long storage periods.

Upon ignition, the propellant grains are ignited by the igniter pellets. Combustion starts and produces pressurization gases for the duration for which the propellant grains were designed. The burning rate of the grain, and in turn the gas pressure level of a solid propellant system, is affected by grain bulk temperature. Within a given service temperature range, the grain is designed to produce required gas pressures and flow rates at the lower temperature limit. When operating at a higher temperature, the pressure level will be maintained by a regulator which vents all excess gases overboard. The required grain charge is sized for full propulsion system operating duration at the upper temperature limit, at which maximum grain burning rate occurs.

The selection and design of solid propellant gas generator pressurization systems must consider potential problem areas, notably the following:
(1) Chemical and temperature compatibility of the gases with the propellants
(2) Pressure regulation difficulties
(3) System clogging by solid particles carried in the gas stream
(4) Lack of restart capability
(5) Requirement to vent gas rapidly in the event of premature engine cutoff.
A brief discussion of several commonly used solid propellant systems follow:

1. Solid propellant gas generator system without cooling.-This system is shown schematically in figure 5-10 and consists of a solid propellant charge, including igniter, filter, and hot gas regulator or orifice. This system is suitable mainly for relatively short durations. Upon ignition, hot gases are fed through the filter, regulated, and ducted to the main propellant tanks. The regulator dumps excess gas overboard, for which a vent line must be provided. As an alternate, an orifice may be installed in place of the regulator. In the latter case, the engine thrust level is a direct function of the solid gas generator pressure which in turn is a function of environmental temperature.
2. Solid propellant gas generator system with solid coolant.-This system (fig. 5-11) consists of a solid propellant charge and igniter, a sublimating solid coolant, a filter and a regulator. In operation, the hot gases generated are cooled as they pass through a bed of solid material, subjecting it to decomposition or sublimation. Thus the cooling process simultaneously results in additional gases available for pressurization. The gases finally pass through a filter and are regulated and ducted to the main propellant tanks.

In a typical design an ammonium nitrate base propellant is used with a theoretical flame temperature of $2320^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Oxalic acid pressed into pellets is the solid coolant. This chemical decomposes endothermically at temperatures above $250^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, producing a mixture of $\mathrm{CO}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$. and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The desired temperature level of the mixed product gases is achieved through selection of the propellant to coolant ratio. Final gas temperatures as low as $400^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ have been obtained.

3. Solid propellant gas generator system with azide cooling pack.-The principal components of this system are shown in figure 5-12. Here, hot gases are cooled when passing through a bed of azide material which decomposes and yields essentially pure nitrogen. However, the gas leaving the azide pack is often contaminated with metal particles resulting from the decomposition of the azide. These have to be removed in a cyclone separator. The gases are filtered to remove any remaining particles, then regulated, and directed to the main propellant tanks.

The advantage of these pressurization sys-

tems is in providing relatively pure nitrogen gas at a reasonable temperature level (as low as $600^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ).
4. Helium system with solid propellant gas generator heating. -This system (fig. 5-13) consists of a high-pressure helium storage vessel with a solid-propellant gas generator mounted internally, a filter, and a pressure regulator. The solid-propellant charge provides both heat for helium expansion and additional pressurizing gas. A disadvantage of this system is the need for a relatively large, high-pressure storage vessel.

## Liquid Propellant Gas Generator Pressurization Systems

Both liquid monopropellant and liquid bipropellant gas generators have been used successfully for generating pressurant gases in

engine systems with relatively long operating durations. The selection and design of a gas generation system must consider propellant compatibility, operating temperature limits of propellants and tank materials, and gas molecular weight.

Among the monopropellants, hydrazine is considered the most satisfactory with respect to chemical characteristics and molecular weight of the product gases. The decomposition products of hydrazine can be made even lighter by catalytic decomposition of the ammonia component. The gases contain no carbon, deposits of which could lower the heat transfer rate if a heat exchanger is used for cooling. The theoretical gas decomposition temperature of pure hydrazine is $1800^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Additives can be used to reduce the temperature level.

To meet the requirement for compatibility with the propellant, bipropellant gas generators possess the flexibility of operation at either fuel-rich or oxidizer-rich conditions. Thus the same propellant combination can be used to produce both a fuel-compatible and an oxidizercompatible pressurant gas. For instance, nitrogen tetroxide in combination with hydrazine, UDMH, and various other amine fuels permits hypergolic starting and stable operation in either fuel- or oxidizer-rich modes.

Several avenues are open to meet the pressurant gas temperature requirement. The aforementioned flexibility to operate at either fuel- or oxidizer-rich conditions has the additional advantage to combust well off stoichiometric mixture ratios, resulting in lower temperatures. A limitation exists if one of the bipropellants is also a monopropellant which continues to decompose exothermically. The cooling effect can also be obtained by injecting into the hot gases a given amount of noncombustible liquid which absorbs heat when evaporating. A third method of cooling is heat exchange with one of the liquid propellants in a heat exchanger. This can be applied with essentially any propellant combination, provided the cooling liquid can safely absorb the heat transferred from the gas.

The requirement of low molecular weight will be met by most fuel-rich product gases if they are at approximately $1000^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, where the complex organic compounds composing most fuels are cracked into simple gases of low molecular
weight. However, if excess fuel is injected to lower the temperature to well below $1000^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, this benefit is not obtained, resulting in a gas with high molecular weight which readily condenses.

Liquid-propellant gas-generator pressurization systems, some of which will now be discussed, require relatively complex components and controls. Their selection and application is determined mainly from vehicle mission requirements, such as long operating duration, restart, etc.

1. Single gas generator system with injection cooling.-Here, a single generator provides pressurant gas for both the fuel and the oxidizer tank. The liquids employed consist of either a monopropellant and a nonreacting injection coolant, or a bipropellant combination with cooling achieved by injecting an excess of one propellant. As shown in figure $5-14$, system components include a small, high-pressure helium gas storage vessel assembly (including start, relief, and fill valves), a pressure regulator, two liquid storage vessels, and a gas generator assembly (including controls).

This system is potentially simple and reliable. The product gases are cool enough for use in the propellant tanks. The difficulty is to find a combination of liquids that will produce a product gas meeting all requirements, including compatibility with both propellants. It has been demonstrated, however, that fuel-rich gases can

be used to pressurize storable oxidizers. For instance, ammonia-rich, ammonia-nitrogen tetroxide gas generator products and hydrazine decomposition products with either water or ammonia injection have been successfully applied as the pressurant for storable oxidizers.
2. Single gas generator-helium system.Figure 5-15 shows the main components comprising this system. The number of propellant tanks depends on whether a monopropellant or bipropellant gas generator is used. The hot gas generator products are ducted to a heat exchanger where heat is transferred to the cold helium. The heated and expanded helium gas is then used to pressurize the main oxidizer tanks, while the gas generator gases are used to pressurize the main fuel tank. While the system efficiently uses the available heat for both tanks, it has the disadvantages of requiring a moderate-size, highpressure helium storage vessel and of pressure regulation problems.
3. Dual bipropellant gas generator system with injection cooling.-The major components for this system are shown in figure 5-16. During operation, fuel and oxidizer are fed to the gas generators by pressurizing the auxiliary propellant tanks with helium. One gas generator operates with excess fuel injection to produce relatively cool, fuel-rich gases which are used directly to pressurize the main fuel tank. The second gas generator operates with excess oxi-

dizer injection to produce relatively cool, oxidizer-rich gases which are used directly to pressurize the main oxidizer tank. A design problem is produced by the need to balance the output of the two gas generators and to provide proper pressure control in both tanks. Gas temperatures as low as $600^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ have been successfully generated with these systems.

## Main Propellant Tank Direct Injection Pressurization Systems

The direct injection systems employ injection of small quantities of fuel and oxidizer into the main oxidizer and fuel tanks, respectively. Following hypergolic reaction, the pressurizing gases are thus produced within the main propellant tanks themselves. The fuel system (fig. 5-17) includes a small, high-pressure helium storage vessel assembly, a helium pressure regulator, and two small auxiliary propellant tanks from which propellants are injected into the main tanks. The series injection system (fig. 5-18) consists of only one auxiliary oxidizer tank for main fuel tank pressurization, or vice versa, instead of two separate auxiliary tanks for each main tank. The series system takes advantage of the situation where one of the main propellant tanks can operate at a slightly lower pressure than the other. In the case shown in Figure 5-18, a small quantity of the main fuel supply is fed through a regulator to the main

oxidizer tank. Although these systems appear to offer the lightest and simplest method of pressurization by number of components, system safety, reliability, and ability to produce steady regulated tank pressures are questionable.
